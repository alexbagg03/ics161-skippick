--- Description ---
The inspiration for this game came to me when I was sitting in dead-stop traffic on the freeway and suddenly I
thought, "Huh, I wonder if I could make a game about skipping across traffic?" With that question in mind, I had
intended to create a game where the player could be empowered by skipping across traffic, basically as a "screw you"
to traffic. But since the assignment required AI, I decided to alter the purpose of the game to more of a racing and
rhythm based game.

Now the intent is that the player feels empowered by landing the "boost skips" in the game in a rhythmic way while
also racing against AI. So instead of focusing on leaving traffic behind, as I wish I could have while stuck on the
freeway, the player would leave opponents in the dust by landing consecutive boost skips.
